### ðŸ‘‹ Hi. Iâ€™m Ruth. But I prefer Alanna.

I'm a Web Developer that focuses on front-end JavaScript frameworks such as React. I have a passion for Design Systems, Web Accessibility, and Serverless Technologies such as AWS and Google Cloud. To expand my skills, I am currently focused on building a JAM (JavaScript API Markup) stack for a non-profit organization called Women Who Code.
