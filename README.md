### 👋🏾 Hi. I’m Ruth. But I prefer Alanna.

I'm a Web Developer that focuses on front-end JavaScript frameworks such as React. To expand my skills, I am currently learning the backend as I navigate through Lambda School's 18-month intensive Fullstack Development program. Outside of work, I spend most of my time reading, writing to share what I've learned, and coding in order to solidify my understanding of new concepts.
